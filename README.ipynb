This will determine the shape of a normal distribution from which mean coverage per haplotype will be sampled. Alternatively, an array with the coverage means per haplotypic chromosomes can also be inputted. Then, the number of reads per haplotype per site will be sampled from a poison distribution. Finally, the reads of each allele (A, C, G and T) will be sampled from a multinomial distribution in which the probability of sampling an error allele is `e/3` and sampling the correct allele is `1-e`. Finally, `ploidy` columns will be sum together to form the allele read counts for an individual."
